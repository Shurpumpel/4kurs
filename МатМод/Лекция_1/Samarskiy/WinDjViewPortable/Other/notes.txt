- and avoid the pesky toolbar.

ASSOCIATIONS
============
I've associated .djv, .djvu, and .bookmarks.

To associate more is very simple:
1. Navigate to: App\AppInfo\Launcher
2. Open WinDjViewPortable.ini with Notepad or any text editor

3. Under [RegistryKeys], add:
-=HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\.***

4. Under [RegistryValueWrite], add:
HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\.***\=REG_SZ:DjVu.Document

5. Replace *** with file type.
6. Save .INI file.
